  Description: A command for reposting a message and its content (including files, temporarily) to another chat, and clearing up any remnants, i.e., the command trigger and target message.
  
  Designed for relocating messages to a chat with an appropriate topic. Not suitable for archiving message attachments.

  
	! NOTE ! 

	Embedded attachment content will only be preserved for up to 2 weeks. There is nothing I can do to resolve this. This is a limitation with Discord.

	! NOTE !
