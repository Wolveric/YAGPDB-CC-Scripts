  Description: Created as an override enhancement to the built-in role assignment management commands.
  This will enable simple, controlled management, over the specific roles, that can be managed with these commands, while also allowing the use of role mentions for assignment.

  ! NOTE !
  
  This script is designed to override the -giverole and -takerole commands, it is important to put in place controls for use of the base command for this to be successful.
  Additionally, the command automatically matches against server prefixes interally, so make sure you've changed your prefix in the trigger, if your server prefix is different, or the system won't work.
  I recommend this https://regex101.com site, if you have any issue troubleshooting when changing your prefix, with Golang selected on the right-hand side.

  ! NOTE !

        The configuration for this command, involves entering all valid assignment arguments, into this collection, as shown in the example.
        It's recommended, this be the name of the role, followed by it's ID, to allow usage of the command, mirroring the built-in system, as well as for readability.

		Additionally, this second collection defines a list of role IDs giving overriding permission to use this command, in the control panel.
		Following a similar recommendation above, this is recommended to be the name of the role as the key, followed by it's ID, once again, as shown.

		! NOTE !

		Do NOT add roles, that aren't selected in the drop-down in the control panel, and don't have permission to manage roles, as this will allow them to use the command causing it to error.
