# Script Snippets
The scripts featured in this section, are likely to be notably different from the rest of those found in my repository.
While they are likely to be functional, they will be generally designed to serve little to no immediate purpose, instead demonstrating the greater functionality they are designed to enable.

To this end, they will be designed to be ubiquitous, easily be transplanted, adjusted for use, or to work in conjunction, with, other scripts, to quickly enable commonly employed, but more complex functionality, such as enabling the simplified extraction of switch and flag arguments, or listening for a follow-up response to a command.
This also means, these scripts may involve potentially complex configuration and integration, as they are not designed to provide any notable beneficial functionality as a standalone script, instead designed with more advanced use, by experienced developers, in mind.

Commands will still be marked down with their purpose and any significant usage information, in the heading comment for each script, as well as being commented with any important configuration information, as well as the section of the script pertaining to the actual script itself, being marked out between **{{/\* SCRIPT START \*/}}** and **{{/\* SCRIPT END \*/}}** comments.
