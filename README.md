<h1 align="center">Wolveric's YAGPDB Custom Commands</h1>

## Implementing Custom Commands
These commands are supplied with the understanding that users will have some experience of how to create and use a custom command.
This repository will be separated into folders of related or similar commands, with an accompanying `README.md` document, detailing the contents of the folder, and their use cases. Most categories will group standalone commands with similar uses, but can all be implemented and used separately, without issue.
Any folders of commands that work as a system, will be clearly marked as such in their dedicated `README.md` document, and will require you to add *all* commands, unless otherwise specified on an individual basis.

Each individual command file will have a leading comment, describing the commands function, and the purpose of it's design, as well as a recommended trigger type and trigger. this should inform how it should be set up in YAGPDBs control panel.
